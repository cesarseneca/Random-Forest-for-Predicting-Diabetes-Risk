# Random Forest for Diabetes Prediction 🍏🍩

## Project Overview 🌟
This project aims to predict the likelihood of **diabetes** in patients using machine learning techniques. By leveraging **Random Forest** algorithms, the model identifies patterns in key health indicators to provide accurate predictions and support decision-making in **diabetes prevention and management**. 💡


## Key Features 🔑

### Data Preparation 🧹
- **Dataset**: Medical records including health metrics such as glucose levels, BMI, and blood pressure. 🩺
- **Cleaning**: Removed duplicates, outliers, and anomalous values based on domain knowledge. 🧼
- **Normalization**: Standardized numerical features for optimal model performance. ⚙️

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 🔍
- Visualized data distributions and relationships using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**. 📊
- Generated **heatmaps** to identify correlations between features. 🌡️

### Modeling 🤖
- **Algorithm**: **Random Forest Classifier** implemented using **Scikit-learn**. 🌲
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimized using **GridSearchCV** for improved accuracy. 🔧
- **Evaluation**: Assessed model performance with metrics like accuracy and confusion matrices. 📉

### Results 🏆
- The model achieved an **accuracy score of 0.81** on the test dataset, demonstrating strong predictive performance. 🎯
- Key features such as **glucose levels** and **BMI** were identified as critical indicators for diabetes prediction. 🍩
